How to connect to RS232 TTL Transceiver Module

1. Go to Bluetooth Settings under System Settings and add a new device. A wizard will start. Search your bluetooth device and type the PIN of the bluetooth module (1234 by default)
2. By now you will be paired with the device and will appear under the Devices window named as "linvor". Click on it and you will see its MAC adress.
3. Once you know your paired bluetooth MAC adress open and type in your terminal
		"rfcomm bind 0 [device MAC address]"
	Now we can communicate with our paired device trough /dev/rfcomm0
4. Download Putty for linux and set the following options:
        -Connection type --> Serial
	-Serial line --> /dev/rfcomm0
	-Speed --> Choose whatever you want (9600 baudrate by default)
5. Click Open and you're set =)
